Drain and mash; set aside.\n\nMeanwhile, in deep skillet, saute pork over medium-high heat, mashing with fork, until no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Drain off fat.\n\nAdd mushrooms, celery, stock, onions, garlic, salt, pepper, savory, thyme, cloves, cinnamon and bay leaf; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until almost no liquid remains, about 25 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Mix in potatoes. Let cool.\n\nOn lightly floured surface, roll out 1 of the pastry discs to scant 1/4-inch (5 mm) thickness. Fit into 9-inch (23 cm) pie plate. Spoon in filling. Roll out remaining pastry. Brush pie rim with water; cover with top pastry and press edge to seal. Trim and flute.\n\nRoll out scraps; cut out holiday shapes. (Make-ahead: Wrap tourtiere and shapes separately; refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Or overwrap in heavy-duty foil and freeze for up to 2 weeks; thaw in refrigerator. Add 20 to 30 minutes to baking time, covering with foil after 45 minutes; remove foil for last 10 minutes.)\n\nMix egg yolk with 2 tsp (10 mL) water; brush three-quarters over top. Arrange cutouts on top; brush with remaining egg wash. Cut steam vents in top.\n\nBake in bottom third of 400 F (200 C) oven until hot and golden brown, about 50 minutes.","source":"http://www.canadianliving.com/food/classic_tourtiere.php","rate":"5","dificult":"Moderate","time_preparation":120,"tags":"meat,pie,Canadian food","category":"Meat Pie"},{"id":2,"name":"Croque monsieur","short_description":"The croque monsieur is a dish so iconically, ridiculously French that it's one of the first items of vocabulary that many aspiring linguists learn (trust the French to give the cheese and ham toastie a fancy name and pretend they invented it).

Brush one side of each slice of bread liberally with melted butter and put under the grill butter-side uppermost until golden and crisp, then set aside.\n\n2. Stir the flour into the remaining butter to make a paste, cook for a minute, then gradually whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until smooth. Simmer for a few minutes, until thickened, then take off the heat and stir in 30g cheese until melted. Grate in a little nutmeg, stir and season lightly.\n\n3. Spread the untoasted sides of the bread with mustard, then put the ham on top, followed by the cheese, and pop under the grill for a couple of minutes until the cheese has melted.\n\n4. Top with the rest of the bread, with the toasted side uppermost, and push down, then put the sandwiches on to the grill tray and top with bechamel sauce. Grill for about 5 minutes, until golden and bubbling, and serve immediately.\n\nIs the croque monsieur the world's finest toastie, or an overrated, overpriced Parisian cafe cliche? Do you prefer it plain, or drenched in bechamel sauce, fried or grilled – or even topped with a fried egg or, God forbid, a pineapple ring?","source":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jul/05/how-cook-perfect-croque-monsieur","rate":"0","dificult":"Easy","time_preparation":20,"tags":"sandwich, cheese, ham, French food, snacks","category":"Sandwich"}]
